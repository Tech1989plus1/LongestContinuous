# LongestContinuous
  - Longest Continuous function takes a list of numbers and returns the length of the longest continuous stretch of a single number.
  - ex: [1,7,7,3], the correct return is 2, because there are two 7's in a row. On the input [1,7,7,3,9,9,9,4,9], the correct return is 3, since there are three 9â€™s in a row.
